                <p>Renting a car can be a convenient way to travel, but understanding rental car insurance is essential to avoid unexpected costs and risks. Many renters are unsure if they need extra insurance or if they are already covered by their personal auto policy or credit card. In this guide, we’ll break down the different types of rental car insurance, when you need it, and how to save money.</p>
                <p>When deciding whether to purchase rental car insurance, it’s also important to consider the specific terms and exclusions of each coverage type. For example, a Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) often excludes certain damages, such as those caused by reckless driving, off-road use, or driving under the influence. Liability coverage limits may also vary by location, and in some countries, it is mandatory to purchase additional liability insurance even if you have personal auto coverage. </p>
